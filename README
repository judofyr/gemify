== What
I like you. Thanks to NewGem you have finally learned to share code. By simply
running a command you'll get a filled up directory with lots of goodies. But
sometimes you don't need all this awesome stuff. Sometimes you don't want your
project to be filled up with unneeded stuff, when all you want to do is
building a gem. And that's when you should use Gemify!

== How
Gemify gives you one single executable you should run: gemify. It does
one thing and, hopefully, it does it well. All you need to do is to run that
command in your project-folder. All your files in the lib-folder will be
requirable and all your files in the bin-folder will be executable.

When you run gemify it will asks you some questions, and give you the option
to save your settings (in the file .gemified). So you should never need to
re-enter anything.

== Install
sudo gem install gemify

== Contribute
