== What
I like you. Thanks to NewGem you have finally learned to share code. By simply
running a command you'll get a filled up directory with lots of goodies. But
sometimes you don't need all this awesome stuff. Sometimes you don't want your
project to be filled up with unneeded stuff, when all you want to do is
building a gem. And that's when you should use Gemify!

== How
Gemify gives you one single executable you should run: gemify. It does
one thing and, hopefully, it does it well. All you need to do is to run that
command in your project-folder.

Then it will automatically detect which VCS you're using and include the files
which are under version control. If you're not using a VCS it will just
include the files in the bin- and lib-folders

If you need more control over the included files, you should create a file
named MANIFEST (or Manifest.txt or .manifest) with the filenames separated by
newline. (You can also generate one by running <tt>gemify-manifest</tt>)

You are free to structure your programs the way to want, but remember: Only
the files in the lib-folder will be requirable and only the files in the
bin-folder will be executable.

You will also have the option to save your settings (to .gemified) so you
should never need to re-enter anything.

== As a library
If you want to use Gemify as a library, please look at Gemify::CLI and
Gemify::Base.

== Install
sudo gem install gemify

== Contribute
The source is availble at Gitorious[http://gitorious.org/projects/gemify] and
if you want to improve it, simply fork it and implement your awesome ideas
there. You can also send your patches by email to judofyr@gmail.com.
